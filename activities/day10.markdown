# Mapping key concepts of learning as optimization
We'll do a quick class activity to map out the key concepts.  Here is [a list that the instructors put together](../assignments/assignment09/LearningAsOptimizationTakeaways)

# Overfitting in Neural Networks

We'll talk about the common problem of overfitting in neural networks.  Here are some resources to look at to learn more.  We'll go through [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olinml2024/notebooks/blob/main/overfit_and_underfit.ipynb), but we also have some more resources for you to look at.
