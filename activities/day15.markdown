# Reflection mid-semester reflection

We'll show a couple of the graphs from the survey. 

# Choose your own GPT adventure (or let AI choose it for you)

We'll take a quick poll on what to do today. Here are our two proposed activities:
1. Continue watching 3B1B videos together, pausing to talk through what is happening and collecting the variables.
2. Work on the assignment at tables (individual or together) with office hours style help (survey mentioned that office hours have been helpful)
3. Something else that you all propose. Let's take a few minutes at tables to see if you all come up with something else that would be more helpful that what we proposed.

We'll do some quick voting and then decide how to split the rooms.
