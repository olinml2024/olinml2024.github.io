# Share-out your application of LLMs
In [Assignment 14](../assignments/assignment14/assignment14#proposing-an-llm-for-an-application-and-context-you-care-about), we asked you to propose an application of an LLM for a context that you care about. We'll do a share-out about our applications and possibly think about where they fall on some axes (e.g., at Olin or beyond; positive to negative; practical to whimsical).
