# Share-out your application of LLMs
In [Assignment 14](../assignments/assignment14/assignment14#proposing-an-llm-for-an-application-and-context-you-care-about), we asked you to propose an application of an LLM for a context that you care about. We'll do a share-out about our applications and possibly think about where they fall on some axes (e.g., at Olin or beyond; positive to negative; practical to whimsical). 


# LLM Quality Assessed Deliverable and plans for the rest of the semester

We'll talk about the timeline (some details now added to the homepage).


# Images as data

Let's discuss:  
What is different about images compared to a set of variables (like in the Titanic data set)? What about compared to text data?


One common application of image data is in medical image processing. Here's a few recent papers, including one about one about clinical trials.

# Preview of assignment and talking about convolution

We'll learn about convolutional neural networks to process images. First, we need to understand what a convolution means in this context.
