# Debrief on the last assignment

Warm up your brains by refreshing on the last assignment, including the derivation of linear regression... we're going to use it in a minute.
<!--- Possibly do this without computer (unless needed)  -  have them focus on answering a few questions together and prep them for what we might ask at a gate -->

# Ridge Regression

You'll do some more on ridge regression, including an exploration of why it's useful. In class, we're 


# Classification and train/test split in scikit-learn (40 minutes)

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) is a common python library for classic machine learning. 

We are going to do a guided tour of [this Colab notebook on classification](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cAes5ScARNwi3-naPIpl0WnCqpiS5k7x?usp=sharing)
