# Overview of Final Project Structure

We'll walk you through [the final project deliverables, due dates, and assessment](../assignments/assignment17/FinalProject).


# Discuss Projects at Tables

You had some time to think of final project topics and why they are important to you. Take some time and share with folks around you (aim for a group size of around 5) what you came up with.  As a listener feel free to offer additional ideas, mutual interest in the project, or useful clarifying questions (we won't have time for long discussions though).

# Idea Clustering and Team Formation

Write your favorite ideas on Post-It notes and include your name.  Place the Post-Its on the board in the appropriate category.  Once the ideas are clustered, you can congregate by one of the clusters to find students who are interested in similar topics.  Through this process we hope you will find someone to work with or additional ideas for your own project topic (if you are working alone).

If you are not able to find a partner (and want one) or could work alone but are open to having a partner, please fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN8POj2iA2fPjhiQehWcTxvGcy4lJgLs_S_wTZjqbwck0hMA/viewform) no later than 5pm on Thursday November 14th.  If you have a partner already, you do not (and should not) fill out this survey.
