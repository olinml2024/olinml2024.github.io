# Gradients and PyTorch


# Small data mini-project on classification


# Choosing data for your mini-project and start working
Our general recommendation is to choose a dataset that has at least one other person working on that dataset. This is not a requirement, so if you have something you're passionate about, go for it! While this is a solo project, it may be helpful to have others to confer with who are also figuring out the nuances of your dataset. A lot of time in machine learning and data science go into interacting with the data before it even goes into the model. There are many canned (pre-curated data sets) out there which reduce this time, but it's still important to understand your data, as it drives your model. 

We'll do a little activity to help you find others who have overlapping dataset interest.
