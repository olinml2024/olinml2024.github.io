* 10:20-10:25am: Everyone come hang out in MAC128, we'll talk about the plan and answer any logistics questions.
* 10:25-10:45am:  Review CNNs
* 10:45-10:55am: Jess!
* 10:55-12:00pm: GANs

# Say hello to our guests (5 minutes)
Hi guests! Come to Olin and be our students!


# Review CNNs (20 minutes)
* Filter review
* Loss functions: how to know when your model is overfitting or not learning
* Transfer learning
    * Feature extractor
    * Freezing weights

# Quality assessed deliverable preview (5 minutes)
The quality assessed deliverable is now posted.


# Jess give a 5 minute talk! (10 minutes)
Hmm... interesting time math!

Yay, Jess!


# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  (40 minutes)
Let's warm up with a little game: [https://real-or-fake-the-ai-game.onrender.com/](https://real-or-fake-the-ai-game.onrender.com/)
We will rotate which table is the decider (you have 6 seconds to decide).



## GAN simulation activity (30 minutes)
A short video with a very general overview: [https://youtu.be/X994dDnmRmY](https://youtu.be/X994dDnmRmY)

There is lots of code out there with varying degrees of complexity, but one thing to note is that we've learned many of the basic building blocks. Example: https://github.com/sw-song/PyTorch-GAN/blob/master/implementations/dcgan/dcgan.py


## Bonus: Explore some fun image generation applications (alternative activity)
We probably won't get to these in class, but they could be interesting to explore (and may also help you think about your final project deliverables):

# Assignment preview - Project prep (5 minutes)
It's final project time! We are going to kick-off next class and share more details. However, we want you to take a little time to explore in preparation for coming up with a good final project. Our goal is that everyone leaves class Thursday with a final project idea and a partner (if they want one).
