# Debrief on last two assignments
We have two assignments due today. We'll give a little time to debrief and ask questions.

# Discuss Prior Readings on Bias and Regulations

Over the past two weeks, we had two readings that we'd now like to come back to:  
* In [Assignment 11](../assignments/assignment11/assignment11#bias-in-word-embeddings), we read sections 1-4 of the paper [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Venkatesh-Saligrama/publication/305615978_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_as_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings/links/57a20cd508aeef8f311e0871/Man-is-to-Computer-Programmer-as-Woman-is-to-Homemaker-Debiasing-Word-Embeddings.pdf).

* In [Assignment 13](../assignments/assignment13/assignment13#issues-in-regulation-minimizing-harms-and-maximizing-benefits-for-ai), we read the [FACT SHEET: Biden-‚Å†Harris Administration Announces New AI Actions and Receives Additional Major Voluntary Commitment on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-ai-actions-and-receives-additional-major-voluntary-commitment-on-ai/).  You were asked to take notes on the main takeaways.  You were asked to (if you had time) follow at least one link from the document and writeup the main points of that report or resource.

Let's form medium sized groups (6-12 people) and do some discussion on these.
1. Write the main points or themes of each reading on the board. Your group should write down at least 10 things.
2. Discuss the status of the government fact sheet. Here are some guiding questions (use them to the extent they are helpful for good conversation):  
    * What were you already aware of?
    * What (if anything) were you surprised about?
    * Where do you think the US should be putting more or fewer resources?
    * What roles do you see engineers playing in this space? What about other disciplines? 
3. Now go back to the Debiasing Word Embeddings paper. Here are some guiding questions (use them to the extent they are helpful for good conversation):  
    * How did the paper attempt to remove bias?
    * How well did it work?
    * What other strategies could you imagine trying?
    * Do you think it's easier to debias a person or a large language model? Why?
    * What questions are you wrestling with about removing bias? What's the world you want these models to reflect?

# Preview of the next assignment
We'll be wrapping up our exploration of LLMs with one last assignment [Assignment 14 - Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) Part 3](../assignments/assignment14/assignment14).
