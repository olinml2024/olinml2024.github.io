# Debrief on last two assignments
We have two assignments due today. We'll give a little time to debrief and ask questions.

# Discuss Prior Readings on Bias and Regulations

1. In [Assignment 11](../assignments/assignment11/assignment11#bias-in-word-embeddings), we read sections 1-4 of the paper [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Venkatesh-Saligrama/publication/305615978_Man_is_to_Computer_Programmer_as_Woman_is_to_Homemaker_Debiasing_Word_Embeddings/links/57a20cd508aeef8f311e0871/Man-is-to-Computer-Programmer-as-Woman-is-to-Homemaker-Debiasing-Word-Embeddings.pdf).

2. In [Assignment 13](../assignments/assignment13/assignment13#issues-in-regulation-minimizing-harms-and-maximizing-benefits-for-ai), we read the [FACT SHEET: Biden-‚Å†Harris Administration Announces New AI Actions and Receives Additional Major Voluntary Commitment on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-ai-actions-and-receives-additional-major-voluntary-commitment-on-ai/).  You were asked to take notes on the main takeaways.  If you had time, follow at least one link from the document and writeup the main points of that report or resource.

# Preview of the next assignment
We'll be wrapping up our exploration of LLMs with one last assignment [Assignment 14 - Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) Part 3](../assignments/assignment14/assignment14).
