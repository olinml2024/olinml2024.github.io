* 1-1:05pm: Everyone come hang out in MAC128.
* 1:05-1:10pm: We'll provide brief orienting remarks to the class.  We'll go over the high-level learning goals of the course, talk a little bit about what machine learning is, and discuss the distinction we draw between machine learnign and artificial intelligence.
* 1:10-1:15pm: Introduction to the our main activity (see below).
* 1:15-2:15pm: Mapping the Machine Learning Ecosystem
* 2:15-2:30pm: Report out
* 2:30-2:40pm: Orientation to first assignment and basic course logistics.  We'll show you the Canvas page, grading options, how to find office hours, etc.

# Mapping the machine learning ecosystem

Inspired by this visualization: https://anatomyof.ai/img/ai-anatomy-map.pdf, we want you start from a machine learning-based system or technology and draw a system map of the various stakeholders, their interactions, inputs into the system (e.g., energy, cost, knowledge), outputs (impacts of the system), and potential pitfalls and opportunities (e.g., introduction of bias incorporation of multiple perspectives).  As you go, make a list of the key questions that you would like to answer with respect to your system map.

Starting points for stakeholders:

Data workers

Backbone AI models

Specialized models

…

What questions would you ask ChatGPT to better understand this ecosystem?

Principles:

try to examine things from both a positive and negative point-of-view (e.g., can pitfalls be turned into opportunities).  We don’t want to gloss over potential harm.  We want you to take as broad a look as possible.

Example:

I’m working on mapping out the SeeingAI app.
