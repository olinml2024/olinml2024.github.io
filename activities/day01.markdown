# The Big Picture

TODO (discuss key learning objectives, general course philosophy and approach).

What is machine learning? Is it different than AI?  How does that distinction relate to what we'll be doing this semester.

# Mapping the machine learning ecosystem

A few years back when we were originally designing this course, we were struck by this incredible visualization of a machine learining-powered system (the Amazon Echo).  (note: click on the following link to see [the original, high-resolution, vector graphics version](https://anatomyof.ai/img/ai-anatomy-map.pdf)).

We don't necessarily recommend diving into the nitty gritty here, but we do want to point out some of the interesting features of this map.

1. This map looks at the lifecycle of the system.  This includes development, manufacturing, usage, and disposal.
2. This map examines the diverse (along many dimensions) group of people that interacts with the Amazon Echo.
3. This map shows relationships between different organizations (e.g., transportation companies and distributors).
4. This map explores a variety of inputs and outputs to the product (e.g., data, energy, raw materials, human knowledge).

One of the hallmarks of this course will be in contextualizing machine learning systems within larger systems (e.g., economic, social, environmental) so we can better understand the likely impacts of machine learning technology and how we, as engineers, can increase positive outcomes while reducing negative ones.  We'll have dedicated class activities and readings to help make the picture clearer of how machine learning fits into various contexts, but today we want you to dive into the deep end of the pool and do some research to map out a machine learning system of your choosing.

## Step 1: Do Some Background Reading

Read the article [Machine Learning Lifecycle Explained](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/machine-learning-lifecycle-explained).  This article will give you a nice high-level view of what it takes to create a machine learning model.  The article doesn't look at all of the possible dimensions you migh consider, but it does give some good jumping off points (e.g., the article doesn't talk about electricity or environmnetal impacts).

## Step 2: Choose a Machine Learning System to Map

You probably have a few in mind that you are interested in thinking about. For the purposes of this exercise you should probably choose examples that you are already familiar with (or that you can quickly lookup key information).

Here are some ideas off the top of our heads:
* Large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
* Google
* Generative image models (e.g., Midjourney)
* The [SeeingAI app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seeing-ai/id999062298) (Microsoft's app to make various tasks more accessible for folks who are blind)
* Job applicant screening tools
* Self-driving cars
* Fitness, health, and safety features in Apple Watches (e.g., fall detection, health monitoring, etc.)

## Step 3: Make your Map

Using a sheet of butcher paper, draw a system map of the various stakeholders, stakeholder interactions, inputs into the system (e.g., energy, cost, knowledge), outputs (impacts of the system), potential pitfalls, and opportunities.  As you go, make a list of the key questions that you would like to answer to better understand how your chosen system (if you have time, you may throw these into a search engine or an LLM to see if you can get some quick ideas as to an answer).

Here are some prompts to consider to help get you thinking:
* Who is involved?  Consider data creators, research scientists, data labelers, machine learning engineers, user-experience specialists, consumers, legislators / regulators, etc.
* Who are the organizations? Of the folks involved, what organizations are they a part of (these could be governmental, commercial, or non-profit).
* Where are the interaction points?  How do individual or organizations interact with each other?  What is exchanged between them (e.g., knowledge, money, data, computing resources)?
* With respect to the benefits of the system, consider the experience of the end user (what do they get from using the system?), consider the knock-on benefits to the system creator (e.g., providing more training data), and does anyone else benefit?  With repsect to potential pitfalls (or negative impacts), consider issues of environmental and financial imapct along with the potential for model bias that causes differential impacts to different groups of people that interact with the system (e.g., based on some identty characteristic like race or gender).

## Step 4: Share Your Map

Make sure you take a high-resolution picture of your map and add it to [this shared Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nzF3k-ps9xWlojtOrpTjxBW6dR3eAT3gPl61rK9_QF0/edit?usp=sharing).  We'll give each team a chance to discuss an interesting feature of their map (there won't be time to present the map in its entirety, so you'll have to choose 1-2 things to share).
