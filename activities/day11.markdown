# Share out about small data projects! 

We want to celebrate and share about your small data mini-projects. Hooray, you did it! We'll do a little share-out so that you can learn from each other and give high fives!


# Key takeaways from the mini-project

We'll take a moment to summarize some of the key takeaways from this project. 


# Reflection on the course so far

We're approaching the midpoint of the course (not quite yet), but this felt like a good time to pause and reflect on how things are going.
