# Share out about small data projects! 

We want to celebrate and share about your small data mini-projects. Hooray, you did it! We'll do a little share-out so that you can learn from each other and give high fives!


## Share at tables

Let's start out by sharing what you did with the folks around you.  Take about 2 minutes each to go over what you did for the project and how it turned out.

## If you feel inclined, step up to the front

If you have something you want to show the class (could be something you are proud of, a hard fought lesson, advice, etc.), please jump up and connect to the projector.

# Key takeaways from the mini-project

Let's mix up the seating.  Please sit with people you don't normally sit with.  As a group make a list of key takeaways for this project.  Some good prompts would be:

1. New things I learned through this project are...
2. I solidified my knowledge of...
3. Next time I use machine learning I will be sure to...

Take about 10 minutes for this in groups and then we'll do a 10 minute share out.

# Reflection on the course so far

We're approaching the midpoint of the course (not quite yet), but this felt like a good time to pause and reflect on how things are going. 

First we'll debrief at tables. Then we'll devote a some time to reflecting via a survey (see "Interim reflection on course so far" in Canvas).

# Quality Assessed Deliverable: Key concepts of ML as Optimization

One of the quality assessed deliverables for this course is a check-in on Key Concepts of ML as Optimization. In class last week, you made concept maps of the course content related to ML as optimization. We are planning to use an in-class, on paper assessment. The goal of this assessment is for you to demonstrate your understanding of the key concepts related to ML as optimization (see this [Learning As Optimization Takeaways](../assignments/assignment09/LearningAsOptimizationTakeaways) for details about what we expect). 

While we know that you'll be using external resources for any future ML work that you do, we want to take this time to check in about your conceptual understanding of key ideas. We also want you to get a sense of what you understand well enough to articulate, which may be different than what we understand well enough to nod along to. The assessment will be designed to be done without the need for external sources (if calculators are needed, we'll let you use your phones for this part). Through some recent conversations, we're wrestling with how to both extend trust and also not ask you to carry the burden of willpower to not use external resources for a take-home assessment. We're curious to hear what you think about this!

If you have any accommodations that we need to prepare for to make this assessment work for you, please let us know so we can best support you. Our tentative plan is to give lots of time to complete the assessment in class and have it be the last activity before lunch (so folks can leave when they are done without putting time pressure on folks who want more time). 

Please show up to class for this assessment if you can. If you are out sick, we can schedule a make-up time.

# Preview of next assignment and text as data

In addition to preparing for the Key Concepts of ML as Optimization assessment, we have another assignment to kick off our next module: TEXT! text. Text?
