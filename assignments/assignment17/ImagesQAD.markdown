# Learning Objectives

The intent of this quality assessed deliverable is to demonstrate your understanding of a few key concepts from the Images as Data module (largely focusing on convolutional neural networks).  

Most of the questions pull directly or indirectly from your prior assignments. The intent here is to minimize the workload (assuming you have been keeping up on your assignments) and to revisit concepts from the assignments now that you have had a chance to ask questions in class.
