# Learning Objectives

The intent of this quality assessed deliverable is to demonstrate your understanding of a few key concepts from the Images as Data module (largely focusing on convolutional neural networks).  

Most of the questions pull directly or indirectly from your prior assignments. The intent here is to minimize the workload (assuming you have been keeping up on your assignments) and to revisit concepts from the assignments now that you have had a chance to ask questions in class.

* Identify and explain key components of a convolutional neural network (CNN)
* Create and apply filters like a CNN
* Calculate the output size and values resulting from a given filter

Will be a Canvas quiz.

1. Calculate the output size of an image after some filter.
2. Manually calculate a particular value in an image given some filter and some image.
3. Write code that will result in any vertical edges showing up as positive values if the the edge is darker on the right and lighter on the left and as negative values if the edge is darker on the left and lighter on the right.  
4.
