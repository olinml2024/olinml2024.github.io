<p>What are your learning goals for this project? How might they relate to the Venn diagram? 
(Just to be clear, we are not suggesting that you need to try to be in the center of the Venn diagram.)</p>

<p>Given your reflection on where I hope to grown in this project, where on the Venn diagram does your ideal project land?</p>

<p>You share this in terms of percentages in each of these three categories (they should add to 100%, because math).  We’ve also requested that your project is no more than 70% in one category.</p>

<p>Implementation:  [implementation]</p>

<p>Context &amp; Impact : [context]</p>

<p>Theory: [theory]</p>

<p>Which of these statements best aligns with your current thinking about the project?
I want to reinforce some skills I’ve started to learn already.

<p>How would you prefer to work on this project regarding finding a partner?</p>

<p>Anything else we should know?</p>

<h1 id="deliverable-proposal">Deliverable proposal</h1>
<p>Your projects have a lot of variability in their topics and learning goals, and we want to give you the freedom to choose deliverables that are appropriate for your project and best support your learning. We also want to make sure that you feel you are being fairly assessed and that we (your team and the teaching team) have a shared sense of what a “good” output looks like. Therefore, at some point in your project, you will propose what you think appropriate final deliverables will look like for your project, and we will discuss this together (probably via a check-in conversation).</p>

<p>You should be sure to read  this: Report and/or Code Submission</p>

<p>This proposal should reference your learning goals. (Since what you are doing should probably support your learning goals.)</p>

<p>We strongly suggest that you point to some existing source to give an example of what you might model your deliverables on. For example, if you wanted to make a blog entry to give a detailed explanation of the theory behind a new method (convolutions on graphs), you might point to this example and say “I’m thinking about doing something like this: https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/” Links to an external site.Or, you might be focusing on implementation and context, and you could decide to point back toward your report from module 1 as an example.  You don’t have to find the perfect deliverable template, but showing us an example might help clarify your own thinking and also lead to a clearer conversation with us.</p>

<p>We generally suggest that this conversation happens during the week of November 29. However, it might be appropriate to have this conversation earlier (pre-Thanksgiving) or later (Dec 10 at the latest.).  When you are ready to have this conversation, you should sign-up for a meeting slot on the spreadsheet Links to an external site.and submit the proposal here at least 24 hours in advance (therefore, this assignment is due on Dec 9 at the latest).</p>

<h1 id="final-project-deliverable-submission">Final project Deliverable submission</h1>
<p>Use this assignment to turn in appropriate, project-specific deliverables.  Depending on the project you chose, these may take on a variety of forms.  You will propose appropriate deliverables for your project in this assignment (Deliverable proposal and discussion (final project)). Here are some other important guidelines for your project deliverables to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Guideline 1: Any aspect of the project that you would like us to assess should be included in your submission with clear guidance on what is what (e.g., a repository of code, Colab notebooks, a final report). Deliverable should be uploaded instead of linked (e.g., please upload a pdf of a report instead of linking to a google drive); for some deliverables, a link may be more appropriate, so chat with us if this is the case (e.g., you made a huge dataset and can’t upload it to canvas; or your code is written with a large number of function files).
Guideline 2: Your deliverables should properly frame the project and contextualize your work.  This means that the deliverable should be stand-alone in the sense that someone who hasn’t been following along with your project for the last several weeks should be able to understand what you did.  Additionally, your deliverables must “tell the story” of your project.
Guideline 3: In your individual final reflection you will be able to help us understand both what you got out of this project and what your general approach to the project was.  This information does not need to be duplicated in the deliverables here.
Guideline 4: Please attribute to others appropriately (including a link when possible). When writing about context or theory, this means citing your sources (format of this depends on your deliverable). You do not need to write all of your own code from scratch (for many situations, it’s actually a great choice to build off of the code of others, depending on what your learning goals are). However, you should be clear about what you wrote and what was taken directly from other sources. This gets a little fuzzy in code-land, so we’ll try to provide some guidance here. You don’t need to attribute to every stackoverflow page that helped you solve a problem (even if it means you copied a few lines of code to fix something). If you are working with a kaggle dataset and used someone else’s code as a guide for your data loading and analysis, you should be sure to note this.</p>

<h1 id="2021-reflection">2021 Reflection</h1>
<p>In this assignment you will reflect on what you learned through the course of doing this project and on your process / constructive engagement with the project.</p>

<p>There is no specific format that your reflection must take, but it should contain the following content.</p>

<p>What did you learn / take away from this project?  You might touch on specific content knowledge, teaming skills, new ways of thinking about the world, etc.  In addition to telling us what you learned, please provide some specific examples / pointers to evidence that helps us understand, in detail, what this meant in the context of your project.</p>

<p>What went well for you in this project? And how would you like to improve your approach for future projects / classes / life?</p>

<p>What new things do you want to learn after working on this project?  (think of these as jumping off points or key takeaways for you as you continue your journey at Olin and beyond!).</p>

<p>How would you grade your personal (i.e., not team), constructive engagement on this project?  As guidance, you might consider our class rubric on constructive engagement <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/137LKE5SBLGwmQfQOFcwmIesLeGqv5UYEtp9o0Jw573o/edit?gid=1612299881#gid=1612299881">past rubric</a>. Please assign yourself a grade out of 100.  (Even though this assignment is worth 75 points, we want the grade out of 100.  We will rescale your grade appropriately).</p>

<p>How could the project be set up to better support learning? (this one is to help us in future iterations of the class).</p>

<h1 id="project-check-in">Project check-in</h1>
<p>In order to effectively use this short meeting time, we plan to read through this submission beforehand, so you must have it done before 8 am. It is important that your status document contain a detailed picture of where you are in the project along with any roadblocks or major questions that you have.</p>

<p>Please break your status report into sections to support quick reading. Your project status check should contain the following elements:</p>

<p>Project title
Your names
1-3 sentence description of your project
Current detailed status of your project (what you have accomplished so far)
How do you view your progress so far on a scale of 1 to 7? 1 means you have made very little progress; 4 means you have made good progress; 7 means you have made amazing progress.
Estimate of how many hours have you spent working on this project since last Friday (11/12)?  Include class time. If partners, report for each person separately.
What would you like help with? What would you like feedback on? (Try to provide some detail here if possible so we can have a little time to contemplate your questions before we talk.)
You current work for our reference (code, notes, reading list, whatever is appropriate for your project).  You can upload this to Canvas or submit links to shared document or github (just please make sure we have access). You don’t have to include everything, but having access to this will help us understand your current status and give you better help (especially since everyone is working on very different projects).</p>

<p>Purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Something for your resume / portfolio</li>
  <li>Learn about something interesting and/or meaningful</li>
  <li>Build specific skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Our commitments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support your learning / growth (enable your purposes)</li>
  <li>Certify to external stakeholders that graduates of this class have appropriate learning (build trust with external stakeholders that Olin grades are meaningful)</li>
  <li>Potentially provide extrinsic motivation and accountability for you to learn in a situation with other external pressures (other classes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Purposes of deliverables:</p>

<p>Project deliverable:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For us, the primary purpose of this is to practice producing a high quality piece of work that demonstrates your understanding of material. This enables us to build a better estimate of your understanding. This enables you to practice an important skill and to provide accountability and understanding of your own knowledge.</li>
  <li>This may serve an optional secondary purpose for you, such as creating a portfolio or resume piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbal interview:
For you, this is an opportunity to practice a very short technical interview and to demonstrate your understanding of the material. Potentially, this also creates a sense of personal accountability for you to make sure that you understand the content of your project, especially in a world where it is 
For us, this gives us a second data point in evaluating your understanding.</p>

<p>OR
Project deliverable:
This is a final presentation</p>

<p>Project reflection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For you, this process of reflection will help you improve your abilities and to understand more about yourself.</li>
  <li>For us, this helps us have more context about your experience in the project. We acknowledge that assessments of “quality” and “demonstrating understanding” are somewhat subjective, that project work is not always distributed equally, and that people come to the class with different levels of experience.</li>
