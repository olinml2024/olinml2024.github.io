# Multilayer Neural Networks

* Link to 3B1B video again.
* Show Reyerson
* Link to [Companion notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olinml2024/notebooks/blob/main/ML24_Assignment08.ipynb).

* Implementation in Pytorch for logistic regression and then neural network (logistic regression will be from class).


# Preventing Overfitting

* Batches
* Dropout
* L2 Penalty
